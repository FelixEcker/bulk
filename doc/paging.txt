bulk has an array of page-start positions stored in
 char **bulk_t.pages;

Each element of this array is a pointer to a place within the buffer of where
the page at the according index starts.
The initial state is always [*0], when a page is displayed the display function
checks if the next page is already catalogued, if not it appends an element to
the pages array with its value being the end of the current page plus one.

When a resize signal is received, bulk should rebuild the page catalogue up
until the current pages pointer.

The current page ist stored in
 size_t bulk_t.current_page;
